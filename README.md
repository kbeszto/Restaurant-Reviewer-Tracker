## Keep Track of your Favourite Restaurants

**What will the application do?**

This Restaurant Tracker will provide users the ability to create their own collection of restaurants that they have visited. 
Each visited restaurant will allow users to attach a rating, price value, location, and specify
what type of cuisine the restaurant is. Additionally, users will be able to view their collection of visited restaurants based 
on price and location. It will keep track of all the visited restaurants the user has added, and the attached details 
within each restaurant. 

**Who will use it?**

Anyone who wishes to keep track of their food adventures in their city! This will be beneficial for those who may be eating
on a budget, or to those who are in a rush and need a restaurant in their area. Everyone will be able to use this app: 
we all have our favourite restaurants, why not keep track of it? 

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

Vancouver has so many amazing, authentic restaurants that are run by people from all over the world! I 
hope to encourage individuals to explore the cultures of the world through the experience of food. 
Now that COVID-19 restrictions have loosened, we are finally able to enjoy all the different cuisines across the city.
Through this app, I wish to help people manage and sort their favourite restaurants.

**Phase 4: Task 3**

In different circumstances, I would change the whole functionality of this project; however, there is nothing that I'd 
particularly like to refactor. I would like to throw a few exceptions and extend a few classes.
Everything included in the Restaurant class are setters and getters that
allow for details mentioned above to be attached to each restaurant. 
With a heavier workload this semester, I was unable to put as much time as I hoped I could into this project.
Although it was not exactly what I envisioned, I am still proud of the time and effort I put into this.
